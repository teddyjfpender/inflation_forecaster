# Financial Indicator Forecasting SDK: Technical Report

## Introduction

This report documents the design and implementation of the Financial Indicator Forecasting SDK, a standardized and extensible framework for developing forecasting models for financial indicators such as Consumer Price Index (CPI) and other economic variables.

## SDK Architecture

The SDK follows a modular architecture to separate concerns and promote reusability:

1. **Configuration Management**: YAML-based configuration for models, data sources, and parameters.
2. **Data Fetching**: Unified interface for retrieving data from BLS, FRED, and Yahoo Finance.
3. **Model Management**: Standardized model training, evaluation, and prediction.
4. **Historical Prediction Storage**: JSON-based storage for tracking forecasts over time.
5. **Visualization**: Utilities for generating and saving charts.

## Core Components

### Configuration (config/model_config.yaml)

The configuration file is the central control point for the SDK. It specifies:

- Target variable to forecast
- Feature variables to include in models
- Model parameters and hyperparameters
- Data source configurations

Example configuration:

```yaml
target_variable: target_CPI_12_month_change
feature_variables:
  - crude_oil
  - natural_gas
  - sp500
  # Additional features...
models:
  multiple_linear_regression:
    fit_intercept: false
  random_forest:
    n_estimators: 100
    random_state: 42
  # Additional models...
```

### SDK Interface (src/sdk.py)

The core SDK class provides a unified interface for working with models and data:

```python
sdk = FinancialForecastingSDK('config/model_config.yaml')
data = sdk.prepare_data()
models = sdk.train_models(data)
predictions = sdk.forecast(data, days_ahead=30)
sdk.update_historical_predictions()
sdk.plot_forecasts()
```

Key methods:
- `load_config()`: Loads and parses the YAML configuration.
- `prepare_data()`: Fetches and preprocesses data from various sources.
- `train_models()`: Trains multiple models based on configuration.
- `forecast()`: Generates predictions for future dates.
- `update_historical_predictions()`: Updates the JSON store of predictions.
- `plot_forecasts()`: Visualizes forecasts for all models.

### Data Fetching (src/data_fetcher.py)

The data fetcher module provides functions to retrieve data from:

- Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for CPI data
- Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) for economic indicators
- Yahoo Finance for market data

Each API client has error handling, caching, and rate-limiting mechanisms.

### Models (src/models/*.py)

Model implementations are separated into:

- `simple_models.py`: Traditional ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- `advanced_models.py`: (Optional) More complex models (LSTM, etc.)

Each model implementation includes:
- Training function
- Prediction function
- Evaluation function
- (Where applicable) Confidence interval calculation

### Store Manager (src/store_manager.py)

The store manager handles:

- Loading/saving the JSON prediction store
- Adding new predictions
- Filtering and retrieving historical predictions
- Tracking when predictions were last updated

### Utilities (src/utils.py)

Common utilities for:

- Logging configuration
- Chart generation and saving
- File I/O operations
- Metric calculation
- Time measurement

## Using the SDK

### Basic Workflow

1. **Configure**: Edit config/model_config.yaml to set targets, features, and model parameters.
2. **Train**: Use `--train` flag to train models on historical data.
3. **Forecast**: Use `--forecast` flag to generate predictions.
4. **Visualize**: Use `--plot` flag to generate charts.
5. **Track**: Review historical predictions in the JSON store.

### Advanced Usage

The SDK can be integrated into larger applications:

```python
# Custom workflow example
from src.sdk import get_sdk

# Load SDK with custom config
sdk = get_sdk("my_custom_config.yaml")

# Train specific models
data = sdk.prepare_data()
models = sdk.train_models(data)

# Generate monthly forecasts for a year
for month in range(12):
    monthly_data = get_monthly_data(month)
    predictions = sdk.forecast(monthly_data, days_ahead=30)
    save_monthly_forecast(month, predictions)
```

## Performance Evaluation

To evaluate model performance:

1. **Historical Backtesting**: Compare predictions against actual values.
2. **Feature Importance**: Analyze which features contribute most to accuracy.
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² across models.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Advanced Model Support**: Add transformer models, Bayesian methods, etc.
2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Add auto-tuning of model parameters.
3. **Web Interface**: Develop a dashboard for visualization and monitoring.
4. **Real-time Data Integration**: Add streaming data capabilities.
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual patterns in incoming data.

## Conclusion

The Financial Indicator Forecasting SDK provides a standardized and extensible framework for developing, evaluating, and deploying forecasting models. The modular design allows for easy customization and extension to meet specific forecasting needs.
